    <h1>Privacy Policy for Humva Recorder</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Last Updated: November 27, 2025</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Humva Recorder is a Chrome extension designed to help users record browser tabs or desktop screens for personal or professional use. 
            This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your data when you use our extension. 
            By installing and using Humva Recorder, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            Humva Recorder only collects data that you explicitly choose to capture through the extension’s core recording function:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Screen/ tab content (including text, images, videos, and audio) that you actively record by clicking the "Start Recording" button.</li>
            <li>Local settings (e.g., preferred recording format, export options) that you configure within the extension.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Important Note:</strong> No data is collected automatically, passively, or without your explicit action. 
            We do NOT collect personally identifiable information (PII), health data, financial information, location data, web history, user activity, or any other sensitive data.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Use of Data</h2>
        <p>
            All captured content and settings are used solely to provide the extension’s core functionality:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Storing your recordings locally on your device for easy access.</li>
            <li>Allowing you to export recordings in your preferred format (via the <code>downloads</code> permission).</li>
            <li>Maintaining your personalized settings across browser sessions (via the <code>storage</code> permission).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            No data is used for analytics, advertising, or any purpose unrelated to the extension’s single purpose (screen/tab recording and local content management).
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Permissions & Their Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            Humva Recorder requests the following Chrome permissions to enable its core features. All permissions are used exclusively for local functionality (no remote data transfer):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>tabs</code>: Accesses tab titles and URLs to associate recordings with their source tab (e.g., labeling a recording "YouTube - Tutorial Video").</li>
            <li><code>tabCapture</code>: Captures audio/video streams of active browser tabs for tab-specific recording.</li>
            <li><code>desktopCapture</code>: Captures desktop screen content for full-screen recording scenarios (e.g., recording multiple windows).</li>
            <li><code>storage</code>: Stores your local settings (e.g., export format, recording quality) and recording metadata (no actual content is stored via this API).</li>
            <li><code>downloads</code>: Allows you to export recorded files to your device’s local storage.</li>
            <li><code>scripting</code>: Injects lightweight scripts to optimize recording compatibility with web pages (e.g., adjusting video playback for smooth capture).</li>
            <li><code>notifications</code>: Sends real-time alerts (e.g., "Recording Started" or "Export Completed") to keep you informed of task status.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Data Storage & Protection</h2>
        <p>
            All captured content and settings are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> (via Chrome’s native storage APIs and your device’s file system). 
            No data is uploaded to any remote servers, cloud storage, or third-party services.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have full control over your data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can delete recordings directly from your device’s file manager.</li>
            <li>You can reset extension settings via the extension’s "Settings" page, which clears all stored preferences.</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the extension will not delete your recorded files (they remain in your device’s default download folder).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Third-Party Access</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell, rent, transfer, or share any user data with third parties. No third-party services, APIs, or servers have access to your recordings, settings, or any other data related to Humva Recorder.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. User Control</h2>
        <p>
            You retain full control over your recording activities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recordings only start when you click the "Start Recording" button and stop when you click "Stop" or close the extension.</li>
            <li>You can pause or cancel recordings at any time.</li>
            <li>You choose whether to save or discard recordings after stopping them.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the extension’s functionality or Chrome’s developer policies. 
            When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. 
            We recommend reviewing this policy periodically for any updates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Significant changes will be notified via a pop-up message in the extension or an update note in the Chrome Web Store.
        </p>
    </section>

        <h2>10. Host Permission Usage Limits</h2>
        <p>
            Humva Recorder requests <code>host_permissions</code> only to access content from web pages/tabs that you explicitly select for recording. This permission is used for the sole purpose of capturing the content you choose to record, and:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do NOT scan, monitor, or collect data from web pages you do not actively record;</li>
            <li>We do NOT access sensitive page content (e.g., login forms, payment pages) unless you explicitly include them in a recording;</li>
            <li>Host permission access is limited to the duration of your recording session—access ends when you stop recording.</li>
        </ul>
