    <h1>Privacy Policy for Humva Recorder</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Last Updated: December 6, 2025</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Humva Recorder is a Chrome extension designed to help users record browser tabs or desktop screens for personal or professional use. 
            This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your data. 
            By installing and using Humva Recorder, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            Humva Recorder collects data solely to provide its core recording and video generation functionalities. We only collect data when you actively initiate a recording or log in to our service.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Account Information:</strong> When you log in via <code>humva.studio</code> or <code>test.humva.com</code>, we process your authentication token to verify your identity and manage your recording history.</li>
            <li><strong>Screen & Audio Content:</strong> We capture the video and audio content of the specific tabs or screens you explicitly choose to record.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Settings:</strong> Local preferences (e.g., recording resolution, audio source) configured within the extension.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> We do NOT collect browsing history, financial data, health data, or personally identifiable information (PII) other than what is required for authentication.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Use of Data</h2>
        <p>
            All captured content is used exclusively to fulfill the extension’s purpose:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cloud Storage & Processing:</strong> Due to browser storage limits (IndexedDB), large video files are uploaded to our secure cloud servers (<code>humva.com</code>) and processing servers to ensure data integrity.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Management:</strong> We use authentication data to associate recordings with your account and allow you to manage or download your videos from our dashboard.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Execution:</strong> To generate product promotion videos or process asynchronous tasks via our dedicated calculation services.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Permissions & Their Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            Humva Recorder requests specific permissions to enable its features. All host permissions are strictly limited to our service domains:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>host_permissions</code> (e.g., <code>https://humva.studio/*</code>, <code>https://humva.com/*</code>): Required to communicate with our backend servers for user login, obtaining cloud storage (COS) credentials, uploading large video files, and querying task status.</li>
            <li><code>tabs</code> & <code>tabCapture</code>: To access the title of the tab being recorded and capture the media stream.</li>
            <li><code>desktopCapture</code>: To allow recording of the entire screen or specific application windows.</li>
            <li><code>storage</code>: To save user preferences and temporary states locally.</li>
            <li><code>downloads</code>: To allow users to download their processed videos from our servers to their local device.</li>
            <li><code>scripting</code>: To optimize page compatibility during recording sessions.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Data Storage & Protection</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike extensions that store data purely locally, <strong>Humva Recorder utilizes secure cloud storage</strong> to handle large video files that exceed browser limits.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong> Video data is encrypted and transmitted securely to our designated cloud storage domains after you explicitly consent by starting a recording and logging in.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Access to uploaded content is restricted to the authenticated user.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> You have full control over your data. You can delete your recordings via the extension interface or your account dashboard at any time.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Third-Party Access</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data. We function as the sole data controller.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may use trusted cloud infrastructure providers (e.g., Object Storage Services) solely for the purpose of storing your encrypted video files. These providers do not have rights to access or use your data for their own purposes.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. User Control</h2>
        <p>
            You retain full ownership of your content:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Recording only begins when you click "Start Recording."</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You can stop or cancel the upload process at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You may delete your account or specific video files, which will remove them from our servers.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this policy to reflect changes in functionality or regulations. 
            Significant changes (especially regarding data handling) will be notified via an extension update or email. 
            The "Last Updated" date at the top indicates the latest revision.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>10. Host Permission Usage Limits</h2>
        <p>
            Humva Recorder adheres to Chrome's <strong>Limited Use Policy</strong>. Our use of host permissions is strictly limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Verifying user identity on <code>humva.studio</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Functionality:</strong> Uploading recording data to <code>humva.com</code> and our processing servers because local browser storage is insufficient for high-quality video files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> use host permissions to track user browsing activity on unrelated websites, inject ads, or scrape data for marketing purposes.
